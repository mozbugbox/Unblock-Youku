========
The code were mostly written in [RapydScript](http://rapydscript.pyjeon.com/)
which is a pre-compiler for JavaScript like CoffeeScript. The syntax is basic
Python with a few javascript concept.

CoffeeScript is syntax just too non-python to the taste of mine (mozbugbox).
RapydScript is much more python look alike.

Let's just see how long before the author of Rapydscript lost his enthusiasm
over maintaining the pre-compiler. Finger crossed.
